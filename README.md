# Minishell - 42 Project

## Overview
Minishell is a project assigned as part of the curriculum at 1337 school, focusing on the development of a simple shell. The goal is to create a command-line interpreter that supports executing commands, managing environment variables, and implementing various shell functionalities.

## Introduction
Minishell explores the fundamentals of shell programming, requiring students to build a functional command-line interpreter. It involves parsing and executing commands, managing the environment, and implementing features commonly found in Unix-like shells.

## Features
- **Command Execution:** Execute basic shell commands and programs.
- **Redirection and Pipes:** Support for input/output redirection and pipes.
- **Environment Variables:** Manage and expand environment variables.
- **Built-in Commands:** Implement built-in shell commands (`echo`, `cd`, `env`, `export`, `insert`,...).
- **Error Handling:** Provide informative error messages and handle errors gracefully.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git@github.com:khallal42/minishell.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd minishell`
3. Build the project: `make`
4. Run the shell: `./minishell`

## Implementation
Minishell is implemented in C and involves parsing user input, executing commands, and managing the shell environment. It supports various features commonly found in Unix shells, providing a practical introduction to system calls and process management.
